      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control
                  draft-ietf-rmcat-feedback-message-00

Abstract

   This document describes a feedback message needed to perform
   congestion control for interactive real-time traffic.  This memo is
   an outcome of the design team formed to analyze feedback requirements
   of different proposed congestion control solutions in RMCAT WG and
   design a generic feedback message to ensure interoperability.  This
   feedback message is designed for a sender based congestion control
   approach, which means the receiver of the media will send necessary
   feedback to the sender of the media to do the congestion control at
   the sender.

1.  Introduction

   For interactive real-time traffic the usual choice of protocol is RTP
   over UDP. RTP does not provide any guarantee of QoS, reliable or
   timely delivery and expect underlying transport protocol to do so.
   UDP certainly does not meet that expectation.  However, RTP provides
   RTCP and gives a means to periodically send transport metrics to the
   sender of the media.  For a congestion control algorithm which
   operates at the sender of the media these RTCP messages are MUST
   have.  Unfortunately, there is no standard feedback message only for
   congestion control purpose.  Hence, the congestion control algorithm
   designers usually come up with own RTCP feedback messages that
   support their design choice.  This however, does not make them
   interoperable which can be consider as a barrier for congestion
   control algorithm evolution and standardization.

   To help achieve interoperability for unicast RTP congestion control,
   this memo proposes a common RTCP feedback format that can be used by
   NADA [I-D.ietf-rmcat-nada], SCReAM [I-D.ietf-rmcat-scream-cc], Google
   Congestion Control [I-D.ietf-rmcat-gcc] and Shared Bottleneck
   Detection [I-D.ietf-rmcat-sbd], and hopefully also by any future RTP
   congestion control algorithms.

   In preparing this memo, we have considered the following:

   o  What are the feedback requirements for the proposed RTP congestion
      control candidate solution?

   o  Can we design a feedback message that is future proof, and general
      enough to meet the needs of algorithms that have yet to be
      defined?

   o  Can we use existing RTCP Extended Report (XR) blocks and/or RTCP
      Feedback Messages?  if not, what are the rationale behind new XR
      blocks and/or RTCP feedback messages?

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          June 2016


   o  What will be the wire format of the generic feedback message?

   This memo is structured as follows...

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition the terminology defined in [RFC3550], [RFC3551],
   [RFC3611], [RFC4585], and [RFC5506] applies.

3.  Feedback Message

   The design team analyzed the feedback requirements from the different
   proposed candidate in RMCAT WG. The analysis showed some
   commonalities between the proposed solution candidate and some can be
   derived from other information.  The design team has agreed to have
   following packet information block in the feedback message to satisfy
   different requirement analyzed.

   o  Packet Identifier : RTP sequence number.  The RTP packet header
      includes a incremental packet sequence number that the sender
      needs to identify packet loss in the transmission.

   o  Packet Arrival Time : Arrival time stamp at the receiver of the
      media.  The sender requires the arrival time stamp of the
      respective packet to determine delay and jitter the packet had
      experienced during transmission.  In a sender based congestion
      control solution the sender requires to keep track of the sent
      packets - usually packet sequence number, packet size and packet
      send time.  With the packet arrival time the sender can detect the
      delay and jitter information.  Along with packet loss and delay
      information the sender can estimate the available bandwidth and
      thus adapt to the situation.

   o  Packet ECN Marking : If ECN [RFC3168], [RFC6679] is used, it is
      necessary to report on the 2-bit ECN mark in received packets,
      indicating for each packet whether it is marked not-ECT, ECT(0),
      ECT(1), or ECN-CE. If the path on which the media traffic
      traversing is ECN capable then the sender can use the ECN-CE
      marking information for congestion control.  It is important that
      receiver send the ECN-CE marking information of the packet back to
      the sender to take the advantages of ECN marking.  Note that how
      the receiver gets the ECN marking information at application layer
      is out of the scope of this design team.

   The feedback messages can have one or more of the above information
   blocks.  For RTCP based feedback message the packet information block
   will be grouped by Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier.

3.1.  RTCP Packet format

   The feedback is over RTCP [RFC3550] and is is described as a stand
   alone RTCP packet for now, suitable for use in regular RTCP reports.
   [FIXME: this is simply a placeholder for now.  we can desing
   different wire format of this packet with different efficiency in
   mind.  This doc will contain a very simple format.  The optimized
   versions will be discussed in the group and finally the selected will
   replace the simple format in future]

   where L is a boolean to indicate if the packet was received, ECN is
   the echoed ECN mark of the packet (00 if not received or if ECN is
   not used), and the arrival time offset if the relative arrival time
   of the packet before the report timestamp.

   For each SSRC, there is a sequence number base, followed by PcktCount
   reports (each 16 bits). Pad to a 32 bit boundary if an odd number of
   reports are included.

   The above packet format is expressed as an RTCP XR report block when
   reported with regular RTCP reports.  However, the same block
   information will need a new RTP/AVPF feedback message if reported
   more frequently than regular RTCP report.

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          June 2016


   There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy of reporting, and the
   overhead of the reports.  [I-D.ietf-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] discusses
   this trade-off, and the possible rates of feedback.

   It is a general understanding that the congestion control algorithms
   will work better with more frequent feedback - per packet feedback.
   However, RTCP bandwidth and transmission rules put some upper limits
   on how frequently the RTCP feedback messages can be send from the
   media receiver to the media sender.  It has been shown [I-D.ietf-
   rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] that in most cases a per frame feedback is a
   reasonable assumption on how frequent the RTCP feedback messages can
   be transmitted.  The design team also have noted that even if a
   higher frequency of feedback is desired it is not viable if the
   feedback messages starts to compete against the media traffic on the
   feedback path during congestion period.  Analyzing the feedback
   interval requirement [ref to IETF 95 presentation] it can be seen
   that the candidate algorithms can perform with a feedback interval
   range of 50-200ms.  The design team recommends that a 100ms(?
   [editors note: do we have an agreement here?]) is set by default and
   a higher or lower value can be negotiated at session setup if needed.

   FIXME: It is likely that this draft can turn into a standards track
   specification of the feedback packet formats, and refer to [I-D.ietf-
   rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] as informational guidelines on how to
   configure the RTCP reporting interval.  Need to agree if that is the
   right approach.

5.  Design Rationale

   FIXME: explain, briefly, why a new RTCP feedback message is needed,
   and why we can't use TMMBR or any of the existing XR blocks or AVPF
   feedback messages.

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document is an outcome of RMCAT design team discussion.  We
   would like to thank all participants specially Xiaoquing Zhu, Stefan
   Holmer, David, Ingemar Johansson, Varun Singh, Randell Jesup and
   Michael Ramalho for their valuable contribution to the discussions
   and to the document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   FIXME: this will need to register any new RTCP messages defined

8.  Security Considerations

   FIXME: risk of causing congestion, if an on-path attacker can modify
   these feedback messages to make conditions appear better than they
   are.
