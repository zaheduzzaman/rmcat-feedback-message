      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control
                  draft-ietf-rmcat-feedback-message-00

Abstract

   This document describes a feedback message needed to perform
   congestion control for interactive real-time traffic.  This memo is
   an outcome of the design team formed to analyze feedback requirements
   of different proposed congestion control solutions in RMCAT WG and
   design a generic feedback message to ensure interoperability.  This
   feedback message is designed for a sender based congestion control
   approach, which means the receiver of the media will send necessary
   feedback to the sender of the media to do the congestion control at
   the sender.

1.  Introduction

   For interactive real-time traffic the usual choice of protocol is
   Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
   RTP does not provide any guarantee of Quality of Service (QoS),
   reliable or timely delivery and expect underlying transport protocol
   to do so.  UDP certainly does not meet that expectation.  However,
   RTP provides RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) and gives a means to
   periodically send transport metrics to the sender of the media.  For
   a congestion control algorithm which operates at the sender of the
   media these RTCP messages are MUST have.  Unfortunately, there is no
   standard feedback message only for congestion control purpose.
   Hence, the congestion control algorithm designers usually come up
   with own RTCP feedback messages that support their design choice.
   This however, does not make them interoperable which can be consider
   as a barrier for congestion control algorithm evolution and
   standardization.

   To help achieve interoperability for unicast RTP congestion control,
   this memo proposes a common RTCP feedback format that can be used by
   NADA [I-D.ietf-rmcat-nada], SCReAM [I-D.ietf-rmcat-scream-cc], Google
   Congestion Control [I-D.ietf-rmcat-gcc] and Shared Bottleneck
   Detection [I-D.ietf-rmcat-sbd], and hopefully also by any future RTP
   congestion control algorithms.

   [Editor's Note: consider removing this part of the section in the
   later versions ] In preparing this memo, we have considered the
   following:

   o  What are the feedback requirements for the proposed RTP congestion

      control candidate solution?

   o  Can we design a feedback message that is future proof, and general
      enough to meet the needs of algorithms that have yet to be
      defined?

   o  Can we use existing RTCP Extended Report (XR) blocks and/or RTCP
      Feedback Messages?  if not, what are the rationale behind new XR
      blocks and/or RTCP feedback messages?

   o  What will be the wire format of the generic feedback message?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition the terminology defined in [RFC3550], [RFC3551],
   [RFC3611], [RFC4585], and [RFC5506] applies.

3.  Feedback Message

   The design team analyzed the feedback requirements from the different
   proposed candidate in RMCAT WG. The analysis showed some
   commonalities between the proposed solution candidate and some can be
   derived from other information.  The design team has agreed to have
   following packet information block in the feedback message to satisfy
   different requirement analyzed.

   o  Packet Identifier : RTP sequence number.  The RTP packet header
      includes a incremental packet sequence number that the sender
      needs to identify packet loss in the transmission.

   o  Packet Arrival Time : Arrival time stamp at the receiver of the
      media.  The sender requires the arrival time stamp of the
      respective packet to determine delay and jitter the packet had
      experienced during transmission.  In a sender based congestion
      control solution the sender requires to keep track of the sent
      packets - usually packet sequence number, packet size and packet
      send time.  With the packet arrival time the sender can detect the
      delay and jitter information.  Along with packet loss and delay
      information the sender can estimate the available bandwidth and
      thus adapt to the situation.

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          June 2016


   o  Packet Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Marking : If ECN
      [RFC3168], [RFC6679] is used, it is necessary to report on the
      2-bit ECN mark in received packets, indicating for each packet
      whether it is marked not-ECT, ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE. If the
      path on which the media traffic traversing is ECN capable then the
      sender can use the Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE) marking
      information for congestion control.  It is important that receiver
      send the ECN-CE marking information of the packet back to the
      sender to take the advantages of ECN marking.  Note that how the
      receiver gets the ECN marking information at application layer is
      out of the scope of this design team.

   The feedback messages can have one or more of the above information
   blocks.  For RTCP based feedback message the packet information block
   will be grouped by Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier.

3.1.  RTCP Packet format

   The feedback is over RTCP [RFC3550] and is is described as a stand
   alone RTCP packet for now, suitable for use in regular RTCP reports.
   [FIXME: this is simply a placeholder for now.  we can desing
   different wire format of this packet with different efficiency in
   mind.  This doc will contain a very simple format.  The optimized
   versions will be discussed in the group and finally the selected will
   replace the simple format in future.  This section will describe a
   new RTP/AVPF transport feedback message and a new RTCP XR block
   report ]

   where L is a boolean to indicate if the packet was received, ECN is
   the echoed ECN mark of the packet (00 if not received or if ECN is
   not used), and the arrival time offset if the relative arrival time
   of the packet before the report timestamp.

   For each SSRC, there is a sequence number base, followed by PcktCount
   reports (each 16 bits). Pad to a 32 bit boundary if an odd number of
   reports are included.

   The above packet format is expressed as an RTCP XR report block when
   reported with regular RTCP reports.  However, the same block
   information will need a new RTP/AVPF feedback message if reported
   more frequently than regular RTCP report.

4.  Feedback Frequency and Overhead

   There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy of reporting, and the
   overhead of the reports.  [I-D.ietf-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] discusses
   this trade-off, and the possible rates of feedback.

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          June 2016


   It is a general understanding that the congestion control algorithms
   will work better with more frequent feedback - per packet feedback.
   However, RTCP bandwidth and transmission rules put some upper limits
   on how frequently the RTCP feedback messages can be send from the
   media receiver to the media sender.  It has been shown [I-D.ietf-
   rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] that in most cases a per frame feedback is a
   reasonable assumption on how frequent the RTCP feedback messages can
   be transmitted.  The design team also have noted that even if a
   higher frequency of feedback is desired it is not viable if the
   feedback messages starts to compete against the media traffic on the
   feedback path during congestion period.  Analyzing the feedback
   interval requirement [ref to IETF 95 presentation] it can be seen
   that the candidate algorithms can perform with a feedback interval
   range of 50-200ms.  The design team recommends that a 100ms(?
   [editors note: do we have an agreement here?]) is set by default and
   a higher or lower value can be negotiated at session setup if needed.

5.  Design Rationale

   The primary function of RTCP Sender Report (SR) / Receiver Report
   (RR) is to report the reception quality of media.  The regular SR /
   RR reports contain information about observed jitter, fractional
   packet loss and cumulative packet loss.  These information suppose to
   help flow and congestion control mechanism.  Event though it is
   possible to do congestion control based on information provided in
   the SR/RR reports it is not sufficient to design an efficient
   congestion control algorithm for interactive real-time communication.
   An efficient congestion control algorithm requires more fine grain
   information on per packet (see Section 3) to react to the congestion
   or to avoid funder congestion on the path.

   Codec Control Message for AVPF [RFC5104] defines Temporary Maximum
   Media Bit Rate (TMMBR) message which conveys a temporary maximum
   bitrate limitation from the receiver of the media to the sender of
   the media.  Event though it is not designed to replace congestion
   control, TMMBR has been used as a means to do receiver based
   congestion control where the session bandwidth is high enough to send
   frequent TMMBR messages specially with reduced sized reports
   [RFC5506].  This requires the receiver of the media to analyze the
   data reception, detect congestion level and recommend a maximum
   bitrate suitable for current available bandwidth on the path with an
   assumption that the sender of the media always honors the TMMBR
   message.  This requirement is completely opposite of the sender based
   congestion control approach.  Hence, TMMBR cannot be as a signalling
   means for a sender based congestion control mechanism.  However,
   TMMBR should be viewed a complimentary signaling mechanism to
   establish receiver's current view of acceptable maximum bitrate which
   a sender based congestion control should honor.

   There are number of RTCP eXtended Report (XR) blocks have been
   defined for reporting of delay, loss and ECN marking.  It is possible
   to combine several XR blocks to report the loss and ECN marking at
   the cost of overhead and complexity.  However, There is no existing
   RTCP XR block to report packet arrival time.

   Considering the issues discussed here it is rational to design a new
   congestion control feedback signaling mechanism for sender based
   congestion control algorithm.
