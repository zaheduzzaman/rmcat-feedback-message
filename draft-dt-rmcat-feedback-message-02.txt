      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control
                   draft-dt-rmcat-feedback-message-02

Abstract

   This document describes a feedback message intended to enable
   congestion control for interactive real-time traffic.  The RTP Media
   Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) Working Group formed a design
   team to analyze feedback requirements from various congestion control
   algorithms and to design a generic feedback message to help ensure
   interoperability across those algorithms.  The feedback message is
   designed for a sender-based congestion control, which means the
   receiver of the media will send necessary feedback to the sender of
   the media to perform the congestion control at the sender.

1.  Introduction

   For interactive real-time traffic the typical protocol choice is
   Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
   RTP does not provide any guarantee of Quality of Service (QoS),
   reliable or timely delivery and expects the underlying transport
   protocol to do so.  UDP alone certainly does not meet that
   expectation.  However, RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) provides a
   mechanism to periodically send transport and media metrics to the
   media sender which can be utilized and extended for the purposes of
   RMCAT congestion control.  For a congestion control algorithm which
   operates at the media sender, RTCP messages can be transmitted from
   the media receiver back to the media sender to enable congestion
   control.  In the absence of standardized messages for this purpose,
   the congestion control algorithm designers have designed proprietary
   RTCP messages that convey only those parameters required for their
   respective designs.  As a direct result, the different congestion
   control (a.k.a. rate adaptation) designs are not interoperable.  To
   enable algorithm evolution as well as interoperability across designs

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP     November 2016


   (e.g., different rate adaptation algorithms), it is highly desirable
   to have generic congestion control feedback format.

   To help achieve interoperability for unicast RTP congestion control,
   this memo proposes a common RTCP feedback format that can be used by
   NADA [I-D.ietf-rmcat-nada], SCReAM [I-D.ietf-rmcat-scream-cc], Google
   Congestion Control [I-D.ietf-rmcat-gcc] and Shared Bottleneck
   Detection [I-D.ietf-rmcat-sbd], and hopefully future RTP congestion
   control algorithms as well.

   [Editor's Note: consider removing this part of the section in the
   later versions ] In preparing this memo, we have considered the
   following:

   o  What are the feedback requirements for the proposed RTP congestion
      control candidate solution?

   o  Can we design a feedback message that is future proof, and general
      enough to meet the needs of algorithms that have yet to be
      defined?

   o  Can we use existing RTCP Extended Report (XR) blocks and/or RTCP
      Feedback Messages?  If not, what is the rationale behind new XR
      blocks and/or RTCP feedback messages?

   o  What will be the wire format of the generic feedback message?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition the terminology defined in [RFC3550], [RFC3551],
   [RFC3611], [RFC4585], and [RFC5506] applies.

3.  Feedback Message

   The design team analyzed the feedback requirements from the different
   proposed candidate in RMCAT WG.  The analysis showed some
   commonalities between the proposed solution candidate and some can be
   derived from other information.  The design team has agreed to have
   following packet information block in the feedback message to satisfy
   different requirement analyzed.

   o  Packet Identifier : RTP sequence number.  The RTP packet header
      includes an incremental packet sequence number that the sender




Sarker, et al.            Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP     November 2016


      needs to correlate packets sent at the sender with packets
      received at the receiver.

   o  Packet Arrival Time : Arrival time stamp at the receiver of the
      media.  The sender requires the arrival time stamp of the
      respective packet to determine delay and jitter the packet had
      experienced during transmission.  In a sender based congestion
      control solution the sender requires to keep track of the sent
      packets - usually packet sequence number, packet size and packet
      send time.  With the packet arrival time the sender can detect the
      delay and jitter information.  Along with packet loss and delay
      information the sender can estimate the available bandwidth and
      thus adapt to the situation.

   o  Packet Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Marking : If ECN
      [RFC3168] is used, it is necessary to report on the 2-bit ECN mark
      in received packets, indicating for each packet whether it is
      marked not-ECT, ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE.  If the path on which
      the media traffic traversing is ECN capable then the sender can
      use the Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE) marking information for
      congestion control.  It is important that the receiver sends the
      ECN-CE marking information of the packet back to the sender to
      take the advantages of ECN marking.  Note that how the receiver
      gets the ECN marking information at application layer is out of
      the scope of this design team.  Additional information for ECN use
      with RTP can be found at [RFC6679].

   The feedback messages can have one or more of the above information
   blocks.  For RTCP based feedback message the packet information block
   will be grouped by Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier.

   As a practical matter, we note that host Operating System (OS)
   process interruptions can occur at inopportune times.  Thus, the
   recording of the sent times at the sender and arrival times at the
   receiver should be made with deliberate care.  This is because the
   time duration of host OS interruptions can be significant relative to
   the precision desired in the one-way delay estimates.  Specifically,
   the send time should be recorded at the latest opportunity prior to
   outputting the media packet at the sender (e.g., socket or RTP API)
   and the arrival time at the receiver (e.g., socket or RTP API) should
   be recorded at the earliest opportunity available to the receiver.

3.1.  RTCP XR Block for Reporting Congestion Control Feedback

   Congestion control feedback can be sent as part of a scheduled RTCP
   report, or as RTP/AVPF early feedback.  If sent as part of a
   scheduled RTCP report, the feedback is sent as an XR block, as part
   of a regular compound RTCP packet.  The format of the RTCP XR report

   block is as follows (this will be preceded in the compound RTCP
   packet by an RTCP XR header, described in [RFC3611], that includes
   the SSRC of the report sender):

   The XR Discard RLE report block uses the same format as specified for
   the loss and duplicate report blocks in [RFC3611].  The parameters
   "block length", "begin_seq", and "end_seq" used in the text below
   have the same semantics and representation as defined in [RFC3611].

   All timestamps are derived from the same wall-clock using guidance
   provided in Section 3.  The timestamp units are in 0.1 millisecond
   increments unless specified otherwise via session negotiation
   [Editor's note: Perhaps Colin has better words for RTCP option
   specification and negotiation.]

   Block Type field (BT, 8 bits): The RMCAT congestion control feedback
   Report Block is identified by the constant RC2F.  [Note to RFC
   Editor: Please replace RC2F with the IANA provided RTCP XR block type
   for this block.]

   Report Count field (RC, 8 bits): This field describes the number of
   SSRCs reported by this report.  The number should at least be 1.

   Report Timestamp Field (RTS, 32 bits): This timestamp represents when
   this report was generated and uses the same wall-clock that is used
   for all the receive timestamps arrivals in this report.  As all other
   timestamps in the report will be formulated as time offsets from this
   time, the report timestamp here must be equal to or later than that
   associated with the most recently received packet in this report.
   However, unlike the desired care in send timestamping of sent packets
   (not described in this RFC), this report timestamp need not be as
   accurate as possible relative to the actual time the report is sent.
   That is, the RTS should not be relied upon as the actual send time
   for this report by any entity receiving the report.  The primary
   utility of this timestamp is to provide an anchor for the arrival
   times of the packets contained in this report.

   All the remaining fields described below appear in each individual
   SSRC report block.  The figure above depicts the case for N such SSRC
   source blocks (i.e., RC = N).  All fields are denoted by a SSRC
   source block index i (also shown in figure where space allows).  The
   index for an individual packet data within a SSRC sub block is
   denoted by the index j.

   E field (E_i, 1 bit): This bit set to 1 whenever the ECN bits of all
   received packets in between begin_seq and end_seq, inclusive, for
   this SSRC were received with the identically same ECN bit values.
   This E field bit is set to 0 when this is not true.  When 1, the
   value of ECN bits is reported in the immediately following ECN field.
   When 0, the ECN bits for every received packet in between begin_seq
   and end_seq, inclusive, are reported in a separate C block (described
   below)

   ECN field (ECN_i, 2 bits): When the E field is one, these bits are to
   be set to the ECN bits found in all recieved packts.  When the E
   field is zero, these bits should be set to a value representative of
   those in the received packets (such as the most prevalent value).

   end_seq_delta field (end_seq_delta_i, 13 bits): This is derived from
   end_seq (the ending sequence number for SSRC source block i).  This
   value shall be the lower order thirteen bits resulting from the
   following operation performed in 16 bit or greater unsigned
   precision: the modulo 2^16 subtraction of begin_seq from end_seq
   (both 16-bit unsigned quantities as per [RFC3611]).  We note that the
   number of packets to be reported for this SSRC will be one more than
   end_seq_delta and that at most 8192 ((2^13-1)+1) packets (per SSRC)
   can be reported using this format.  A entity receiving this report




Sarker, et al.            Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP     November 2016


   may thus re-create the end_seq for SSRC i via the modulo2^16 addition
   of begin_seq and end_seq_delta.

   Each sequence number between begin_seq and end_seq, inclusive, is
   represented by an individual 16-bit arrival time offset (ATO) block.
   The ATO blocks (specified below) are simply concatenated together.
   When the ECN bits of received packets are not all identical, they
   will be reported in 2-bit C blocks (specified below) which are
   similarly concatenated together.  The number of ATO blocks and the
   number of C blocks (when required) is equal to the number of packets
   reported for this SSRC (i.e., end_seq_delta_i+1 for SSRC source block
   i).

   Arrival Time Offset field (ATO_i_j, 16 bits): This value is the
   arrival time of the RTP packet at the receiver relative to the report
   timestamp (RTS) for packet j in SSRC i.  If the packet number for the
   seq_no being reported was not received, this field is set to 0xFFFF
   (2^16-1).  Otherwise, it is reported as a positive quantity - and in
   the same timestamp units as the RTS - by the modulo 2^16 subtraction
   of the reception timestamp from the RTS, with the following
   exception.  If the result of this subtraction is greater than 2^16-3
   (i.e., > 0xFFFD), then the value 0xFFFE shall be entered to indicate
   a time difference of greater than 2^16-3 in timestamp units.  This
   allows packets sent up to 6.5532 seconds before the RTO timestamp to
   be reported assuming the default 0.1 millisecond timestamp is
   employed.  As it is desired to 32-bit align all the ATO blocks,
   unused bits (if any) in the last 32-bit word shall be zero padded.
   Thus the number of 32-bit words for the ATO field is
   (end_seq_delta+1)/2 whenever (end_seq_delta+1)/2 is an integer and
   ceil((end_seq_delta+1)/2) when it is not.  The number of 32-bit words
   used in the ATO portion of this report for the first SSRC is depicted
   as K1 in the figure above.

   C field (C_i_j, 2 bits): These fields are required whenever the E
   field is set to zero (indicating that not all the received packets
   had the same ECN bit values).  The C_i_j fields are simply
   concatenated for all sequence numbers between begin_seq and end_seq,
   inclusive.  If the packet corresponding to that sequence number was
   received (ATO value not 0xFFFF), the two bits shall be set to the ECN
   bits for that packet.  If the packet corresponding to that sequence
   number was not received, the value reported in the C_i field for this
   packet is meaningless, may be set to any value (0x00 suggested), and
   should not be saved/recorded or otherwise interpreted as meaningful
   by a recipient of this report.  As it is desired to 32-bit align all
   the C_i blocks, unused bits (if any) in the last 32-bit word shall be
   zero padded.  Thus the number of 32-bit words for the C_i field is
   (end_seq_delta+1)/16 whenever (end_seq_delta+1)/16 is an integer and
   ceil((end_seq_delta+1)/16) when it is not.  The number of 32-bit

   words used in the C_i portion of this report for the first SSRC is
   depicted as K2 above.

   [TODO: Need to agree upon, then document, the compressed version of
   the above.  Could steal one more bit from end_seq_delta field or
   specify a different RTCP XR block type.]

3.2.  RTP/AVPF Transport Layer Feedback for Congestion Control

   Congestion control feedback can also be sent in a non-compound RTCP
   packet [RFC5506] if the RTP/AVPF profile [RFC4585] or the RTP/SAVPF
   profile [RFC5124] is used.  In this case, the congestion control
   feedback is sent as a Transport Layer FB message (RTCP packet type
   205), with FMT=2 (congestion control feedback).  The format of this
   RTCP packet is as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP     November 2016


   The first 8 octets are the RTCP header, with PT=205 and FMT=2
   specifying the remainder is a congestion control feedback packet, and
   including the SSRC of the packet sender.

   Section 6.1 of [RFC4585] requires that the first 8 octets are
   immediately followed by the SSRC of the media source being reported
   upon.  Accordingly, the format of this report is modified from that
   of the RTCP XR report block, by moving the report timestamp to the
   end.  The meaning of all the fields beyond the first 8 octets is as
   described in Section 3.1.

4.  Feedback Frequency and Overhead

   There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy of reporting, and the
   overhead of the reports.  [I-D.ietf-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] discusses
   this trade-off, and the possible rates of feedback.

   It is a general understanding that the congestion control algorithms
   will work better with more frequent feedback - per packet feedback.
   However, RTCP bandwidth and transmission rules put some upper limits
   on how frequently the RTCP feedback messages can be send from the
   media receiver to the media sender.  It has been shown
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] that in most cases a per frame
   feedback is a reasonable assumption on how frequent the RTCP feedback
   messages can be transmitted.  The design team also have noted that
   even if a higher frequency of feedback is desired it is not viable if
   the feedback messages starts to compete against the media traffic on
   the feedback path during congestion period.  Analyzing the feedback
   interval requirement [feedback-requirements] it can be seen that the
   candidate algorithms can perform with a feedback interval range of
   50-200ms.  A value within this range need to be negotiated at session
   setup.

5.  Design Rationale

   The primary function of RTCP Sender Report (SR) / Receiver Report
   (RR) is to report the reception quality of media.  The regular SR /
   RR reports contain information about observed jitter, fractional
   packet loss and cumulative packet loss.  The original intent of this
   information was to assist flow and congestion control mechanisms.
   Even though it is possible to do congestion control based on
   information provided in the SR/RR reports it is not sufficient to
   design an efficient congestion control algorithm for interactive
   real-time communication.  An efficient congestion control algorithm
   requires more fine grain information on per packet (see Section 3) to
   react to the congestion or to avoid funder congestion on the path.

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP     November 2016


   Codec Control Message for AVPF [RFC5104] defines Temporary Maximum
   Media Bit Rate (TMMBR) message which conveys a temporary maximum
   bitrate limitation from the receiver of the media to the sender of
   the media.  Even though it is not designed to replace congestion
   control, TMMBR has been used as a means to do receiver based
   congestion control where the session bandwidth is high enough to send
   frequent TMMBR messages especially with reduced sized reports
   [RFC5506].  This requires the receiver of the media to analyze the
   data reception, detect congestion level and recommend a maximum
   bitrate suitable for current available bandwidth on the path with an
   assumption that the sender of the media always honors the TMMBR
   message.  This requirement is completely opposite of the sender based
   congestion control approach.  Hence, TMMBR cannot be as a signaling
   means for a sender based congestion control mechanism.  However,
   TMMBR should be viewed a complimentary signaling mechanism to
   establish receiver's current view of acceptable maximum bitrate which
   a sender based congestion control should honor.

   There are number of RTCP eXtended Report (XR) blocks have been
   defined for reporting of delay, loss and ECN marking.  It is possible
   to combine several XR blocks to report the loss and ECN marking at
   the cost of overhead and complexity.  However, there is no existing
   RTCP XR block to report packet arrival time.

   Considering the issues discussed here it is rational to design a new
   congestion control feedback signaling mechanism for sender based
   congestion control algorithm.

8.  Security Considerations

   There is a risk of causing congestion if an on-path attacker modifies
   the feedback messages in such a manner to make available bandwidth
   greater than it is in reality.  [More on security consideration TBD.]
