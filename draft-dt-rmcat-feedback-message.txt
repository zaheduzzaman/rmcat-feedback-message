      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control
                   draft-dt-rmcat-feedback-message-00

Abstract

   This document describes a feedback message needed to perform
   congestion control for interactive real-time traffic.  RMCAT WG
   formed a design team to analyze feedback requirements from various
   congestion control solutions proposed and design a generic feedback
   message to ensure interoperability.  The feedback message is designed
   for a sender-based congestion control, which means the receiver of
   the media will send necessary feedback to the sender of the media to
   perform the congestion control at the sender.

1.  Introduction

   For interactive real-time traffic the typical choice of protocol is
   Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) over User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
   RTP does not provide any guarantee of Quality of Service (QoS),
   reliable or timely delivery and expects the underlying transport
   protocol to do so.  UDP alone certainly does not meet that
   expectation.  However, RTP provides RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) and
   provides a mechanism to periodically send transport and media metrics
   to the media sender.  For a congestion control algorithm which
   operates at the media sender, these RTCP messages are important to
   perform congestion control.  Unfortunately, there are currently no
   standard feedback message for assisting the congestion control.
   Hence, the congestion control algorithm designers usually come up
   with their new RTCP feedback messages that support their design
   choice.  This however, does not make them interoperable, which can be
   considered a barrier for congestion control algorithm evolution and
   standardization.

   To help achieve interoperability for unicast RTP congestion control,
   this memo proposes a common RTCP feedback format that can be used by
   NADA [I-D.ietf-rmcat-nada], SCReAM [I-D.ietf-rmcat-scream-cc], Google
   Congestion Control [I-D.ietf-rmcat-gcc] and Shared Bottleneck
   Detection [I-D.ietf-rmcat-sbd], and hopefully future RTP congestion
   control algorithms.

   [Editor's Note: consider removing this part of the section in the
   later versions ] In preparing this memo, we have considered the
   following:

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          July 2016

   o  What are the feedback requirements for the proposed RTP congestion
      control candidate solution?

   o  Can we design a feedback message that is future proof, and general
      enough to meet the needs of algorithms that have yet to be
      defined?

   o  Can we use existing RTCP Extended Report (XR) blocks and/or RTCP
      Feedback Messages?  If not, what are the rationale behind new XR
      blocks and/or RTCP feedback messages?

   o  What will be the wire format of the generic feedback message?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In addition the terminology defined in [RFC3550], [RFC3551],
   [RFC3611], [RFC4585], and [RFC5506] applies.

3.  Feedback Message

   The design team analyzed the feedback requirements from the different
   proposed candidate in RMCAT WG. The analysis showed some
   commonalities between the proposed solution candidate and some can be
   derived from other information.  The design team has agreed to have
   following packet information block in the feedback message to satisfy
   different requirement analyzed.

   o  Packet Identifier : RTP sequence number.  The RTP packet header
      includes a incremental packet sequence number that the sender
      needs to identify packet loss in the transmission.

   o  Packet Arrival Time : Arrival time stamp at the receiver of the
      media.  The sender requires the arrival time stamp of the
      respective packet to determine delay and jitter the packet had
      experienced during transmission.  In a sender based congestion
      control solution the sender requires to keep track of the sent
      packets - usually packet sequence number, packet size and packet
      send time.  With the packet arrival time the sender can detect the
      delay and jitter information.  Along with packet loss and delay
      information the sender can estimate the available bandwidth and
      thus adapt to the situation.

Internet-Draft    Congestion Control Feedback in RTCP          July 2016


   o  Packet Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Marking : If ECN
      [RFC3168] is used, it is necessary to report on the 2-bit ECN mark
      in received packets, indicating for each packet whether it is
      marked not-ECT, ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE. If the path on which
      the media traffic traversing is ECN capable then the sender can
      use the Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE) marking information for
      congestion control.  It is important that receiver send the ECN-CE
      marking information of the packet back to the sender to take the
      advantages of ECN marking.  Note that how the receiver gets the
      ECN marking information at application layer is out of the scope
      of this design team.

   The feedback messages can have one or more of the above information
   blocks.  For RTCP based feedback message the packet information block
   will be grouped by Synchronization Source (SSRC) identifier.

3.1.  RTCP Packet format

   The feedback is over RTCP [RFC3550] and it is described as a stand
   alone RTCP packet for now, suitable for use in regular RTCP reports.
   [FIXME: this is simply a placeholder for now.  We can design
   different wire format of this packet with different efficiency in
   mind.  This doc will contain a very simple format.  The optimized
   versions will be discussed in the group and finally the selected one
   will replace this simple format in future.  This section will
   describe a new RTP/AVPF transport feedback message and a new RTCP XR
   block report ]

   The XR Discard RLE report block uses the same format as specified for
   the loss and duplicate report blocks in [RFC3611].  The fields "block
   length", "begin_seq", and "end_seq" have the same semantics and
   representation as defined in [RFC3611]

   Block Type (BT, 8 bits): The RMCAT congestion control feedback Report
   Block is identified by the constant RC2F. [Note to RFC Editor: Please
   replace RC2F with the IANA provided RTCP XR block type for this
   block.]

   SSRC Count (8 bits): field describes the number of SSRCs reported by
   this report block.  The number should at least be 1.

   SSRC of source (32 bits): The SSRC of the RTP source being reported
   upon by this report block.  This report block MAY report on multiple
   SSRC

   Report Timestamp (RTS, 32 bits): represents the timestamp when this
   report was generated.  [FIXME: It is derived from which clock?]

   Each sequence number between the begin_seq and end_seq (both
   inclusive) is represented by a packet metric block of 16-bits.  And
   contains the L, ECN, and ATO metrics.  [FIXME: if an odd number of
   reports are included, i.e., end_seq - begin_seq is odd OPTION 1: pad
   to a 32 bit boundary?  How do we mark for padding?  OPTION 2: just
   report on higher than received RTP packet.  In both cases the 16bits
   are set to zero.]

   L (1 bit): is a boolean to indicate if the packet was received.  0
   represents that the packet was not yet received and all the
   subsequent bits (ECN and ATO) are also set to 0. 1 represent the
   packet was received and the subsequent bits in the block need to be
   parsed.

   ECN (2 bits): is the echoed ECN mark of the packet (00 if not
   received or if ECN is not used).

   Arrival time offset (ATO, 13 bits): it the relative arrival time of
   the RTP packets at the receiver before this feedback report was
   generated measured in milliseconds.  It is calculated by subtracting
   the reception timestamp of the RTP packet denoted by this 16bit block
   and the timestamp (RTS) of this report.

   [FIXME: the timestamp of the RTP packets and the RTS should be same?]
   [FIXME: needs more information if we go down this path.]

   The above packet format is expressed as an RTCP XR report block when
   reported with regular RTCP reports.  However, the same block
   information will need a new RTP/AVPF feedback message if reported
   more frequently than regular RTCP report.

4.  Feedback Frequency and Overhead

   There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy of reporting, and the
   overhead of the reports.  [I-D.ietf-rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] discusses
   this trade-off, and the possible rates of feedback.

   It is a general understanding that the congestion control algorithms
   will work better with more frequent feedback - per packet feedback.
   However, RTCP bandwidth and transmission rules put some upper limits
   on how frequently the RTCP feedback messages can be send from the
   media receiver to the media sender.  It has been shown [I-D.ietf-
   rmcat-rtp-cc-feedback] that in most cases a per frame feedback is a
   reasonable assumption on how frequent the RTCP feedback messages can
   be transmitted.  The design team also have noted that even if a
   higher frequency of feedback is desired it is not viable if the
   feedback messages starts to compete against the media traffic on the
   feedback path during congestion period.  Analyzing the feedback
   interval requirement [feedback-requirements] it can be seen that the
   candidate algorithms can perform with a feedback interval range of
   50-200ms.  A value within this range need to be negotiated at session
   setup.

5.  Design Rationale

   The primary function of RTCP Sender Report (SR) / Receiver Report
   (RR) is to report the reception quality of media.  The regular SR /
   RR reports contain information about observed jitter, fractional
   packet loss and cumulative packet loss.  These information suppose to
   help flow and congestion control mechanism.  Event though it is
   possible to do congestion control based on information provided in
   the SR/RR reports it is not sufficient to design an efficient
   congestion control algorithm for interactive real-time communication.
   An efficient congestion control algorithm requires more fine grain
   information on per packet (see Section 3) to react to the congestion
   or to avoid funder congestion on the path.

   Codec Control Message for AVPF [RFC5104] defines Temporary Maximum
   Media Bit Rate (TMMBR) message which conveys a temporary maximum
   bitrate limitation from the receiver of the media to the sender of
   the media.  Event though it is not designed to replace congestion
   control, TMMBR has been used as a means to do receiver based
   congestion control where the session bandwidth is high enough to send
   frequent TMMBR messages specially with reduced sized reports
   [RFC5506].  This requires the receiver of the media to analyze the
   data reception, detect congestion level and recommend a maximum
   bitrate suitable for current available bandwidth on the path with an
   assumption that the sender of the media always honors the TMMBR
   message.  This requirement is completely opposite of the sender based
   congestion control approach.  Hence, TMMBR cannot be as a signalling
   means for a sender based congestion control mechanism.  However,
   TMMBR should be viewed a complimentary signaling mechanism to
   establish receiver's current view of acceptable maximum bitrate which
   a sender based congestion control should honor.

   There are number of RTCP eXtended Report (XR) blocks have been
   defined for reporting of delay, loss and ECN marking.  It is possible
   to combine several XR blocks to report the loss and ECN marking at
   the cost of overhead and complexity.  However, There is no existing
   RTCP XR block to report packet arrival time.

   Considering the issues discussed here it is rational to design a new
   congestion control feedback signaling mechanism for sender based
   congestion control algorithm.
